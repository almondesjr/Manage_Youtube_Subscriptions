#
Explanation of the fields:

"client_id": This is a unique identifier for your application. It is used by the OAuth provider (Google in this case) to identify your app when it requests access to user data.

"project_id": This is the identifier of your Google Cloud project. It helps Google's OAuth service identify which project is making the authentication request.

"auth_uri": This is the URL where users will be redirected to sign in and authorize your application to access their Google account information.

"token_uri": This is the URL where your application will send a token request in exchange for an access token. The access token is then used to make authorized requests to the Google API.

"auth_provider_x509_cert_url": This URL provides the public certificates used by the OAuth provider (Google) to sign tokens. Your application uses these certificates to verify the authenticity of tokens received.

"client_secret": This is a confidential key that is used to authenticate your application when exchanging authorization codes for access tokens. It should be kept secret and not shared publicly.

"redirect_uris": This is a list of URLs where the OAuth provider will send users after they have successfully authenticated and authorized your application. In this case, it's set to http://localhost, which is often used for testing purposes.
